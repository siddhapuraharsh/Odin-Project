    <p>
        Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually 
        baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide 
        range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other 
        desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.

    <p>
        The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, 
        a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder.
