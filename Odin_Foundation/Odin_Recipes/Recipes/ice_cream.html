    <p>
        Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. 
        It may be made from dairy milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, 
        either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or 
        with fruit such as strawberries or peaches.
    </p>

    <p>
        Commercial ice cream is made by combining, under constant agitation, the liquid 
        ingredients (milk, cream, syrups, etc.). These liquids are heated and combined 
        with dry ingredients (sugar, stabilizers, dried eggs or milk) to form a mix, which 
        is then pasteurized and homogenized.
